## üéÆ Project Overview

*Gravity Is Your Enemy* is a 2D platformer game developed as the final project for the Game Mechanics and Design course. The game challenges players to navigate through levels where gravity itself becomes the primary obstacle. With intuitive controls and engaging mechanics, players must adapt to shifting gravitational forces to progress.

## üöÄ Features

- **Dynamic Gravity Mechanics**: Experience levels where gravity changes direction, affecting movement and strategy.
- **Challenging Levels**: Navigate through meticulously designed stages that test reflexes and problem-solving skills. The game includes 5 unique levels.
- **Engaging Visuals and Audio**: Simple yet effective graphics complemented by immersive audio and particle effects.
- **Responsive Controls**: Smooth and intuitive controls ensure a seamless gaming experience.
- **Debug Features**: Includes debug keys for level skipping and collision toggling to aid testing.

## üïπÔ∏è Gameplay Mechanics

- **Movement**: Use the **Space** key to thrust upwards, and **A** and **D** keys to rotate the rocket left and right.
- **Collision Handling**: Colliding with friendly objects allows safe navigation, reaching the finish triggers success sequences, and hitting obstacles triggers crash sequences with audio and particle feedback.
- **Level Progression**: Successfully completing a level loads the next; crashing reloads the current level.
